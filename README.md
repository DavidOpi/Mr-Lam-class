# My Greatest Fear
---
## My greatest fear revolves around the thought of not living up to my **expectations**. I do a lot of sports and out of school activities to try and reduce the fear but the constant *thought* in the back of my head keeps telling me I won't make it to the UFC, or get accepted to my Uni, or all my efforts are going to be in vain. :sob:
Will I make it? ~~NO~~
I WILL! 
Reasons why I'll make it:
1. I'm the alpha
2. I'm Mr gillis
3. OLIVER

   | I'm gonna make it | I'M NOT FEARED OF ANYTHING |
   | ----------------  |  --------------------------|
   | My Purpose | |To win|
