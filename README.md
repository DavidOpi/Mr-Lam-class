# My Greatest Fear
---
## My greatest fear revolves around the thought of not living up to my **expectations**. I do a lot of sports and out of school activities to try and reduce the fear but the constant *thought* in the back of my head keeps telling me I won't make it to the UFC, or get accepted to my Uni, or all my efforts are going to be in vain. :sob:
